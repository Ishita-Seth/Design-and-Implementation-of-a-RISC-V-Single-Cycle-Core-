# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-RISC-V-Single-Cycle-Core-
The core supports essential instructions, including Load Word (LW), Store Word (SW), AND, OR, ADD, and SUB operations. The project emphasizes the fundamental aspects of instruction execution, data path design, and control logic in a single-cycle architecture, providing a solid foundation for understanding RISC-V processor design.
